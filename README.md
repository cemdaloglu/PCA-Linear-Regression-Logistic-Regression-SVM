# PCA-Linear Regression-Logistic Regression-SVM
At the very bottom of the Python code, all questions run with in the order of its question number.
I used numpy, sklearn, scipy.io, matplot libraries. Code can be run in terminal command with "python main.py" command after the related libraries are installed.
Some questions asked to plot the results so all plots will be shown while running. In order the code to keep running, you need to close all poped-up plots.
If you want to see the reconstructed version of the first question's van Gogh pictures, you need to uncomment the commented lines in the question_1_1() method.
